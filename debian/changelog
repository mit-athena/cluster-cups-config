debathena-cluster-cups-config (1.0) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Jonathan Reed ]
  * Initial release.

  [ Geoffrey Thomas ]
  * Build-depend on cupsys | cups (by depending on debathena-cups)
    so that it's available for package version testing.
  * Also do something useful with the printers.conf and classes.conf
    files, and bail in the postinst/prerm if we can't stop CUPS while
    attempting to do said useful thing.
